4  papers:
 
1. *Frantal et al. (2022)* 
    - **Molecular Methods**
    - First part they describe is the single-cell sequencing for when we would obtain a cell from the field and want to sequence it so we have the genome
    - Use of oligo-mesotrophic(TS1 0-60) - i.e; ´good - fair´ water quality.
    - Sampling was conducted at the deepest point of lake.
    - Water samples were collected along depth gradients from the surface to above lake bottom - (5-L Schindler-Patalas sampler)
    - A plankton net - (10-μm net gauze)
    - Samples were transported in 1-L plastic bottles at ambient lake water temperatures
    - Processed right after sampling
  
    
2. *Proschold et al. (2022)*
    - 'High-throughput sequencing of the V9 18S rDNA region...' on page 16 - for Field Sampling

3. *Pitsch et al. (2019) *
    - obtain OTUs for all species in the water sampling when we would filter them

4. *Stoeck et al. (2010)*
    - primers used
     
5. Protozoological Monographs - Volume 4, Jan 2009 *Rudolf Röttger, Robert Knight and Wilhelm Foissner (Eds.)*

   - **Practical Techniques - pg 6** 
   - the samples must be taken by means of a bottle or by a vertical water sampler. ln the laboratory, the sample can then be concentrated by fi ltration, centrifugation or sed imentation.
All samples must be kept cool, in a thermos flask or in thermo bags. ln the laboratory they must be kept in a fridge or in a cold culture room.
    - are extremely delicate and must be examined under the microscope as soon as possible.
    - Parallel samples should always be fixed at once in acidic Lugol's iodine untill light brown **Stain**
    - Methods and recipes are given by *Stein (1973)*
    - **For examination of flagella, envelopes and silica scales and bristles**
    - **silica structures** - are best studied in dry mounts. A drop of the sample is simply dried on a coverslip, and the coverslip with the sample downwards is then mounted on a slide by means of Canada balsam or nail varnish in the corners, with objectives x 40 or x 100 (oil immersion).
    - **scales Structures** -  Lugol-fixed material is rinsed in distilled water in a centrifuge. By means of a micropipette a drop of the centrifugate is placed on a formvar coated grid and dried. The material is then ready for examination in the transmission **electron microscope**.

Methods we need:

1. For Morphological identification - (how to prepare samples for identification)

2. Culturing of **Natural** ciliates populations.
    - Try to grow them in the lab. 
    - Have to check the species and environment requirements.

3. Assessment for growth curves and traits.

# Sampling

## 1. Parameters of ciliate water environment.

1. TSI of the pond.
*How to measure Trophic Status of th water body?*

2. OR use of field meter - measure of dissolved Oxygen level(lower the % means poor quality of water) - **YSI PRO 2030** with use of probe

3. PH of water (use of field meter or pH meter) - acidic or basic - usual is between 6 -8 

4. Location

5. Depth

6. Temperature

7. Nitrate

8. Phosphate (Pocket colorimeter II)

9. Maybe Ammonia

![colorimter 2](colorimeter2.png)

## 2. Methods

1. Choose fast flowing wtaer with no steady. No too deep as to prevent stagnant water

2. Rinse sampling water 3 times before taking actual sample

## 3. Recording samples
 - Proper label
 - Proper pen
 - Sample location
 - Sample time
 - Field test results
 - Any special notes
